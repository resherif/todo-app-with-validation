# Todo App with Validation

A simple web-based todo list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with built-in validation to prevent empty or invalid entries. This project demonstrates front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation and form handling.

## Features
- Add new tasks with validation (e.g., no empty tasks, minimum length).
- Mark tasks as completed with checkboxes.
- Edit or delete existing tasks.
- Persistent storage using localStorage (tasks save across page refreshes).
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for styling and layout.
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and validation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/resherif/todo-app-with-validation.git
text2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

No additional dependencies required.

## Usage
1. Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" (validation will alert if invalid).
2. Click the checkbox to mark as complete.
3. Use the edit icon to modify a task or the delete icon to remove it.
4. Tasks are automatically saved in your browser's localStorage.
